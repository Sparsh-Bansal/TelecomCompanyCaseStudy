# TelecomCompanyCaseStudy
In this case study, we gonna build a classification model for a telecommunication company. Lets say you are using some sort of network of a particular company and definitely a network provider wants you to continue with them for a long time. Sometimes it may happen that the person is not satisfied with the company due to any reason and decides to leave the company.Now we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not so that the company could take appropriate actions and it may help them from stopping those customers from leaving from the company.
